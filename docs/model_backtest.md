# Bitcoin DCA Backtest System

This document explains the backtesting framework in `backtest.py` and how to interpret its results for evaluating the dynamic DCA weight computation model.

## Overview

The backtest system validates the dynamic DCA strategy by comparing its performance against uniform DCA (equal daily allocations) across rolling 1-year investment windows from 2018-01-01 to the present.

**Key Metrics:**
- **Win Rate**: Percentage of windows where dynamic DCA outperforms uniform DCA
- **SPD Percentile**: Sats-per-dollar percentile within each window's min/max range
- **Model Score**: Combined metric (50% win rate + 50% exponential-decay percentile)

## Core Components

### Data Loading (`load_data`)

Loads Bitcoin price and MVRV data from CoinMetrics, extending it with today's live price:

```python
btc_df = load_data()
# Loaded CoinMetrics data: 6205 rows, 2009-01-03 to 2025-12-29
```

### Feature Precomputation

Computes all model features once, then reuses them across all windows:

```python
_FEATURES_DF = precompute_features(btc_df)
```

Features include:
- `price_vs_ma`: Distance from 200-day moving average
- `mvrv_zscore`: MVRV Z-score (365-day window)
- `mvrv_gradient`: Trend direction (30-day EMA)
- `mvrv_percentile`: 4-year rolling percentile
- `mvrv_acceleration`: Momentum indicator
- `mvrv_volatility`: Uncertainty measure
- `signal_confidence`: Signal agreement score

### Rolling Window Backtest

For each daily start date from 2018-01-01, creates a 1-year investment window:

```python
# Window: 2018-01-01 → 2019-01-01
# Window: 2018-01-02 → 2019-01-02
# ...
# Window: 2024-12-28 → 2025-12-28
```

**Total Windows**: 2554 (daily rolling windows)

### Sats-per-Dollar (SPD) Calculation

For each window, computes how many satoshis are obtained per dollar invested:

```python
inv_price = 1e8 / price  # sats per dollar
uniform_spd = inv_price.mean()  # equal daily amounts
dynamic_spd = (weights * inv_price).sum()  # weighted by model
```

The **SPD percentile** normalizes performance within each window:

```
percentile = (spd - min_spd) / (max_spd - min_spd) × 100
```

- **0%**: Worst possible timing (bought at highest prices)
- **50%**: Uniform DCA baseline
- **100%**: Perfect timing (bought at lowest prices)

```

**Common patterns in underperforming windows:**
- Bear market entries (2018-2019): Model's value signals trigger too early
- Late-cycle windows (2023-2024): Model may reduce buying before final leg up

## Validation Checks

### Weight Sum Validation

Every window's weights are validated to sum to exactly 1.0:

```python
assert np.isclose(weight_sum, 1.0, atol=1e-5)
# ✓ Validated weight sums for 2554 windows (all sum to 1.0)
```

### Forward-Leakage Test

Ensures weights only use past information:

```python
# For each probe date, mask future data and verify weights unchanged
for probe in sample_dates:
    masked_df = df.copy()
    masked_df.loc[masked_df.index > probe, :] = np.nan
    assert weights_match(masked_df, full_df, at=probe)
```

### Win Rate Requirement

Strategy must outperform uniform DCA in ≥50% of windows:

```python
win_rate = (dynamic_percentile > uniform_percentile).mean()
assert win_rate >= 0.5
```

## Usage

Run the backtest from the command line:

```bash
cd /path/to/bitcoin_modal
source venv/bin/activate
python backtest.py
```

The script will:
1. Load BTC data with today's live price
2. Precompute all model features
3. Run SPD backtest across all rolling windows
4. Validate weights and check for forward-leakage
5. Generate visualizations and export metrics

## Key Functions

### `compute_weights_modal(df_window)`

Wrapper that connects the backtest to the model's weight computation:

```python
def compute_weights_modal(df_window: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.Series:
    """Compute weights using compute_window_weights for validation."""
    start_date = df_window.index.min()
    end_date = df_window.index.max()
    current_date = end_date  # For backtesting, all dates are "past"
    return compute_window_weights(_FEATURES_DF, start_date, end_date, current_date)
```

### `backtest_dynamic_dca(dataframe, strategy_function)`

Main backtest driver that computes SPD statistics:

```python
df_spd, exp_decay_percentile = backtest_dynamic_dca(
    btc_df,
    compute_weights_modal,
    features_df=_FEATURES_DF,
    strategy_label="Dynamic DCA",
)
```

### `check_strategy_submission_ready(dataframe, strategy_function)`

Comprehensive validation for production readiness:
- Forward-leakage test (no future data used)
- Weight validation (non-negative, sum to 1.0)
- Performance check (≥50% win rate vs uniform DCA)

## Performance Characteristics

Based on the current backtest results:

| Metric | Current Value | Target |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Win Rate | 64.45% | ≥ 50% |
| Model Score | 60.33% | Higher is better |
| Mean Excess | +4.07% | Positive |
| Median Excess | +4.41% | Positive |
| Exp-Decay Percentile | 56.21% | > 50% |

The strategy consistently outperforms uniform DCA with:
- **64.45% win rate** (1,646 wins / 908 losses)
- **11% relative improvement** on average
- **Stronger recent performance** (exp-decay average: 56.21%)
